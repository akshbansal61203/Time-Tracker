The purpose of such a Chrome/Edge extension would be to provide users with a quick and convenient way to track the passage of time since the start of the day, month, or year. This can be helpful for various reasons:

Time Management: Users can gauge how much time has elapsed in a day, month, or year to better manage their tasks and deadlines.

Productivity Tracking: It allows users to monitor their productivity by seeing how much of the day, month, or year has already passed and how much remains.

Personal Reflection: Some users may find it introspective to reflect on how they've spent their time within a given timeframe.
